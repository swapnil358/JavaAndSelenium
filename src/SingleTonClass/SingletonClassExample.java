	For example: If database connection is already established, you should not create new connection.

	Basic steps to create Singleton class using Lazy Initialization

	Step 1: Just declare private static variable of the same class (beware don’t instantiate)
	Step 2: Provide private constructor to restrict instatiation from outside class
	Step 3: Provide public static getInstance() method  and check
	Step 3.a: If INSTANCE variable is null, then only instantiate
	Step 3.b: Otherwise, return already instantiated INSTANCE variable
	Note: These are steps for lazy initialization

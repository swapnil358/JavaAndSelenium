		//HashMap is class which implements Map interface

		//it may have one null key and mutiple null value
		//It doesn't maintain order -- no order
		
		
		/*
		 * Hashmap vs Hashtable 
		 *       1. HashMap is non synchronized. It is not-thread safe
		 * and can’t be shared between many threads without proper synchronization code
		 * whereas Hashtable is synchronized. It is thread-safe and can be shared with
		 * many threads. 
		 *       2. HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values whereas
		 * Hashtable doesn’t allow any null key or value. 
		 * 		 3. HashMap is generally preferred over HashTable if thread synchronization is not needed
		 * 
		 * 		Why HashTable doesn’t allow null and HashMap does? 
		 * To successfully store and
		 * retrieve objects from a HashTable, the objects used as keys must implement
		 * the hashCode method and the equals method. Since null is not an object, it
		 * can’t implement these methods. HashMap is an advanced version and improvement
		 * on the Hashtable. HashMap was created later.
